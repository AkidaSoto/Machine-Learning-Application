Biofeedback using Heart Rate Variability

notes: 
"HRV biofeedback produces a 0Â° phase relationship between heart rate and breathing, conditions requiring better gas exchange efficiency could show improvement. Consistent with this, there is evidence for better athletic performance after training in HRV biofeedback (Strack, 2003; Shaw, 2011; Paul and Garg, 2012) and that HRV biofeedback may help improve breathing symptoms and quality of life among patients with emphysema (Giardino et al., 2004)."

"Perhaps it is for this reason that various studies have shown positive HRV biofeedback effects for treating anxiety and depression (Karavidas et al., 2007; Reiner, 2008; Siepmann et al., 2008; McCraty et al., 2009; Nada, 2009; Zucker et al., 2009; Henriques et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2011; Patron et al., 2013)."
