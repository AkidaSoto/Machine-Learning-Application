Atrial fibrillation (AF) classification from a short single lead ECG recording
Paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5978770/
Code and Results from winners: https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/

Notes: "Four teams won the Challenge with an equal high F1 score (averaged across all classes) of 0.83, although the top 11 algorithms scored within 2% of this. A combination of 45 algorithms identified using LASSO achieved an F1 of 0.87, indicating that a voting approach can boost performance."

Single Lead ECG Signal acquisition and classification using Deep Convolutional Networks
https://github.com/manideep2510/ECG-acquisition-classification

notes: 
"Single lead ECG detection using three electrodes"?

"We placed the positive electrode on the left hip, a negative electrode on the right shoulder and a electrode from the left hand wrist is given as a ground reference"

A comparison of 2-lead, 6-lead, and 12-lead ECGs
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14665478/

Notes: "ECG systems, comprising 2 or 6 leads, can be substituted for the 12-lead ECG for certain clinical and research applications (pertaining to the amplitude of QRS complexes)"

Classification of COVID-19 electrocardiograms by using hexaxial feature mapping and deep learning (12-Lead)
-https://github.com/mkfzdmr/COVID-19-ECG-Classification

Notes: "COVID-19 detection performance with an accuracy of 96.20% and F1-Score of 96.30%."

Automatic ECG diagnosis using a deep neural network (12-Lead)
https://github.com/antonior92/automatic-ecg-diagnosis

Notes: 
"A convincing preliminary study of the use of DNNs in ECG analysis was recently presented in ref. 15. For single-lead ECGs, DNNs could match state-of-the-art algorithms when trained in openly available datasets (e.g. 2017 PhysioNet Challenge data16) and, for a large enough training dataset, present superior performance when compared to practicing cardiologists."

"a DNN model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams"

"..a DNN to classify six types of ECG abnormalities considered representative of both rhythmic and morphologic ECG abnormalities."

Biofeedback using Heart Rate Variability
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4104929/

notes: 
"HRV biofeedback produces a 0° phase relationship between heart rate and breathing, conditions requiring better gas exchange efficiency could show improvement. Consistent with this, there is evidence for better athletic performance after training in HRV biofeedback (Strack, 2003; Shaw, 2011; Paul and Garg, 2012) and that HRV biofeedback may help improve breathing symptoms and quality of life among patients with emphysema (Giardino et al., 2004)."

"Perhaps it is for this reason that various studies have shown positive HRV biofeedback effects for treating anxiety and depression (Karavidas et al., 2007; Reiner, 2008; Siepmann et al., 2008; McCraty et al., 2009; Nada, 2009; Zucker et al., 2009; Henriques et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2011; Patron et al., 2013)."
